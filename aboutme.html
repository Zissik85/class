        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp; My name is Mike, I am thirty-four and I am married and have two
          boys.<br />
          Previously I was a Truck Driver, and now I am trying to switch carrers
          so<br />
          that I can spend more time with my family.

    <h2>What I Hope For the Future</h2>
    <p id="last" class="paragraph">
      I am hoping to do well in this course, to change my career so that I am
      not<br />
      away from home twenty days of the month. I'd like to make sure my wife<br />
      does not feel like a single parent, and we can afford a
      <strong>comfortable</strong> life together.
